# NVIDIA Parabricks

- Parabricks offers range of accelerated NGS data processing tools/commands
- [Parabricks documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/parabricks/latest/index.html):
  > "Parabricks was built from the ground up by GPU computing and Deep Learning experts who wanted to develop the fastest and most efficient possible implementation of common genomics algorithms."

- We can use these commands and create a simple NGS data processing workflows with two main stages
  - Read mapping and alignment refinement
  - Variant calling
